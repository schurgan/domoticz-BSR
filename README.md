## Summary
This is a virtual hardware plugin that adds information about collecting days  from [bsr.de](https://www.bsr.de/abfuhrkalender-20520.php)  to your [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) interface. 
Therefore it generate one new alert sensor. Showing the next dates for the waste collection. If the day is coming closer the alarm level will change and finally show red.

As this company only works in Berlin - this plugin does it too.

This plugin is open source.


## Installation and Setup
- a running Domoticz, tested with 4.10717 and 2020.1
- Python 3
- install needed python modules:
  - beautifullsoup4 aka bs4

  - example adaption:
    ```bash
    import sys
    sys.path
    sys.path.append('/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages')
    # for synology python3 from community
    # sys.path.append('/volume1/@appstore/python3/lib/python3.5/site-packages')
    # for synology sys.path.append('/volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages')
    # for windows check if installed packages as admin or user...
    # sys.path.append('C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python37-32\\Lib\\site-packages')
    ```
- restart Domoticz service
- Now go to **Setup**, **Hardware** in your Domoticz interface. There add

### Settings
   - best is to go  [bsr.de](https://www.bsr.de/abfuhrkalender-20520.php)
   - try to find your address
   - remember exactly the street name found for your address. Eg 'Kochstr.' instead of 'Kochstrasse'
   - if recycling is not collected at your house number, try the neighbors.  eg. using 10 instead of 10f

    - Street:
    - Zip code:
    - Number:
    - Update in hours
    - What kind of collection to show
        - 'waste' aka Restmüll or Hausmüll
        - 'recycling' aka Wertstoffe or gelber Sack
        - 'bio' biodegradable waste
        - 'xmas' shows collection dates for xmas trees
    -  Debug: 
       -  if True, the log will be hold a lot more output.
       -  false is the normal mode
       -  true detail -> also shows response on log
       -  True fast full detail -> handles poll time as minutes, for faster debugging
  
## Bugs and ToDos
- bug in blocky, no real support for this kind of alarm switch
- multiple collections on the same day - what to show?
- using Locale for dates,months, days ... works good on windows, breaks on linux
- add feature to create summary device or/and device per type
- own alarm pictures matching the waste type
- Street names often have just "...str." not "....strasse"
- similar street names within same zip code eg: 
    - Am Falkenberg 
    - Am Falkenberg am Wasserwerk
    - booth in 12524

- 

## State
Runs now for several years without any issue... 

## Developing
Based on https://github.com/ffes/domoticz-buienradar/ there are
- `/blz/fakeDomoticz.py` - used to run it outside of Domoticz
- `/blz/blzHelperInterface.py` starting point for some more structure
- unittest under folder `/test`  - it's the new entry point for tests
  - copy `sample_config.ini`  to `my_config.ini` and adapt to your liking
